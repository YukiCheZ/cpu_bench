    summary: CockroachDB key-value transactional performance benchmark
    action: execute concurrent key-value read and write transactions
    description: >
      Launch a local single-node CockroachDB cluster and initialize a key-value dataset.
      Execute a high-concurrency workload of transactional read and write operations with configurable read/write ratios.
      Measure the throughput and latency of database operations to evaluate the CPU's ability to handle distributed database transaction processing.

    summary: TPC-C On-Line Transaction Processing benchmark
    action: simulate complex supply chain database transactions
    description: >
      Deploy a local CockroachDB instance and populate it with a TPC-C compliant dataset scaled by warehouse count.
      Simulate a complex OLTP workload involving order processing, payment recording, and delivery tracking.
      Evaluate the system's transactional throughput and consistency handling under heavy concurrency to assess database performance.
