name: tile38_sim
type: macrobenchmark
language: Go
domain:
  - geospatial
  - query_processing
  - cpu_bound

setup:
  command: ./setup.sh

workloads:
  - name: kdtree
    summary: geospatial query simulation using KD-Tree indexing
    action: execute spatial search and range queries
    description: >
      Generate a synthetic dataset of geospatial coordinates (latitude/longitude) and construct an in-memory KD-Tree index.
      Execute a mix of spatial operations including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) search, within-circle range queries, and intersection checks.
      Measure the query latency and throughput to evaluate CPU performance on geometric calculations and tree traversal algorithms. 
    command: go run src/main.go
