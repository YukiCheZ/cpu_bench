# metadata.yaml for biogo-igor benchmark
name: biogo-benchmark
type: macrobenchmark
language: Go
domain:
  - bioinformatics
  - performance
  - clustering
  - sequence

setup:
  command: ./setup.sh

workloads:
  - name: biogo-igor
    summary: genomic sequence alignment clustering and grouping
    action: perform piling, clustering, and grouping of sequence hits
    description: >
      Generate synthetic genomic sequence alignment hits in GFF format.
      Execute the igor pipeline to process these hits by performing piling, clustering, and grouping operations.
      Serialize the resulting groups to JSON format to evaluate the CPU performance of bioinformatics data processing algorithms.
    command: go run src/igor.go
