    summary: "DeltaBlue incremental constraint solver benchmark for Python"
    action: "solve constraint satisfaction problems using incremental propagation"
    description: >
      Execute the DeltaBlue algorithm to solve constraint satisfaction problems by maintaining a hierarchy of constraints.
      Construct a graph of variables and constraints, then perform incremental updates to satisfy required and preferred constraints.
      Measure the performance of the solver in planning, propagating changes, and maintaining consistency across the constraint network.
    command: python3 run_benchmark.py
