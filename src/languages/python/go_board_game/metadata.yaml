    summary: "Monte Carlo Tree Search AI benchmark for Go"
    action: "execute MCTS simulations to determine optimal moves"
    description: >
      Initialize the Go board environment and configure the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.
      Execute multiple simulation games per move using the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy to explore potential game states.
      Perform random playouts and backpropagate results to update tree node statistics, evaluating the CPU's integer processing and branching performance.
