    summary: "Chaos Game fractal generation benchmark using B-splines"
    action: "perform iterative point transformations for fractal generation"
    description: >
      Load pre-generated spline definitions and simulation parameters to initialize the Chaos Game environment.
      Execute the fractal generation algorithm by iteratively transforming points using B-spline based geometric operations and random selections.
      Perform intensive floating-point calculations to simulate fractal growth and measure the CPU's computational throughput for mathematical modeling.
