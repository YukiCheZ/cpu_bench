    summary: Pure-Python 3D ray tracing rendering benchmark
    action: render 3D scenes using ray tracing algorithms
    description: >
      Initialize a 3D scene containing geometric objects, light sources, and material properties.
      Execute the ray tracing algorithm to calculate pixel colors by simulating light paths, ray-object intersections, and shading effects.
      Perform intensive floating-point arithmetic to render high-resolution images and evaluate the CPU's computational performance.
